========
Kevin's Tar/Untar
========

This is a reimplementation of the tar format for learning purposes. No guarantees are made as to whether or not it will work correctly for anyone else.

Currently only untar is implemented, and only partially.

To build, use

    make

To run, use 

    ./ked_untar archive_filename output_directory

If no output directory is specified, files are extacted to the current working directory.
